# GuLA, Gu's Linear Algebra
Learn linear algebra and its application.

Toy project : gula package, guhwan's linear algebra package
1) Naive implementation of linear algebra algorithm.
   It contains matrix decomposition, vector orthogonalization, equation solver,
   simplex(1D linear programming) and etc.
2) Signal processing topics.
   It contains DFT(descrete fourier transform), Haar wavelet and etc.
3) Couple of problems about number theory.
   About Galois field, Hamming code problems with gula package.
