# Hello-LinearAlgebra
Learn linear algebra and application.

Tiny project : gula package, guhwan's linear algebra package
1) Naive implementation of linear algebra algorithm.
   It contains decomposition, optimization, orthogonalization, etc.
2) Several signal processing topics.
   It contains descrete fourier transform, haar wavelet, etc.
3) Couple of problems about number theory.
   About galois field, hamming code labs by using gula package.


Topics : 
1) Introduction to Linear algebra.
2) Application on Numerical analysis.
3) To use a matrix libraries in practical languages, C++ or Python.

Textbook :
1) Introduction to Linear algebra (Fifth Edition), Gilbert Strang.

Libraries :
1) Numpy, Scientific computing library for Python
   (In this procject, I will use Python 3.x)
2) Eigen, Simple header only library for C++
3) Xtensor, Similar interface to Numpy, C++
   (Specially requires C++ 14)
