# Hello-LinearAlgebra
Learn linear algebra and application.

Topics : 
1) Introduction to Linear algebra.
2) Application on Numerical analysis.
3) To use a matrix libraries in practical languages, C++ or Python.

Textbook :
1) Introduction to Linear algebra (Fifth Edition), Gilbert Strang.

Libraries :
1) Numpy, Scientific computing library for Python
   (In this procject, I will use Python 3.x)
2) Eigen, Simple header only library for C++
3) Xtensor, Similar interface to Numpy, C++
   (Specially requires C++ 14)
